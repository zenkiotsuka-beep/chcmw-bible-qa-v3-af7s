## 📖 CHCMW Mission

> “To empower faithful individuals and families to live out the Gospel through the house church — with love, freedom, and responsibility — in a world where institutional walls may no longer serve all.”

CHCMW operates under the belief that **even one believer praying in a room is the true Church** (Matthew 18:20).
